- To come up (changing light position in mk2 cockpit standard, kerbal stay in shadow :) in facecam
  I'm taking it slow because this is a big piece to be compiled, I don't want to mess up the scene in UNITY
  i have seat animation, lights, new layers mask etc
 
 
 
  
****---- After my training as an IT technician (if all goes well..)----****
- Lots of ideas, animated window IVAs, IVA fit with rasterprop, cargo hold etc but I don't have time for now.
- Need to learn the Asset Browser tool in blender 3.0 to create an object bank to be placed in IVA quickly.
